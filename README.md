My attempt at [Advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Journal

### 2023.12.14
Starting 2 weeks late...
#### Day 1
* First part completed on first go.
* Second part is looking trickier...
* Second part done on first go. Now it's bedtime.

### 2023.12.15
#### Day 2
* First part on first try.
* I feel like I may be over-coding this. It's not like I need to pass a linter of anything. But whatevs...
* Part 2 done on first go. 

### 2023.12.16
#### Day 3
* making sloppy use of string objects...
* got part 1 on second try. Missed an increment.
* Part 2 I got on first go.
* Day 3 complete.

#### Day 4
* Part 1 looks almost too easy. Wonder what the catch is...
* Part 1 done on first go. Part 2 has got to be a doozy right?
* ohhhh boy lol...
* so this is where the recursion begins?
* Ok, so maybe not recursion yet, but I feel recursion coming soon.
* Part 2 done on first go! Totally did not expect that.

#### Day 5
* Part 1 is taking some thought.
* starting more bottom up this time.
* uh-oh, this one is taking awhile to run... Gotta actually start thinking about stuff.
* My first attempt will take an unreal amount of time to run and a ton of RAM. Gotta get smart here...
* First go, right answer. Hell yeah.
* PART 2
* Nearly crashing my computer trying to solve this one.
* switched from max RAM usage to max CPU usage lol.
* Day 5 part 2 looks like one to revisit later.
