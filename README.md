## Journal

### 2023.12.14
Starting 2 weeks late...
#### Day 1
* First part completed on first go.
* Second part is looking trickier...
* Second part done on first go. Now it's bedtime.

### 2023.12.15
#### Day 2
* First part on first try.
* I feel like I may be over-coding this. It's not like I need to pass a linter of anything. But whatevs...
* Part 2 done on first go. 

### 2023.12.16
#### Day 3
* making sloppy use of string objects...
* got part 1 on second try. Missed an increment.
* Part 2 I got on first go.
* Day 3 complete.

#### Day 4
* Part 1 looks almost too easy. Wonder what the catch is...
* Part 1 done on first go. Part 2 has got to be a doozy right?
* ohhhh boy lol...
* so this is where the recursion begins?
* Ok, so maybe not recursion yet, but I feel recursion coming soon.
* Part 2 done on first go! Totally did not expect that.
